# FPGA_HLS

This repo contains some information about High Level Synthesis using Vitis HLS.

The step by step code difficulty level is : 

1-Basic Output
2-Basic Input/Output
3-Traffic Lights

## Basic Output 

The constant value is send to output.

## Basic Input/Output

The data from input is send to output directly.

## Traffic Lights 

Not so basic. The algorithm is in the Vitis HLS code such as comment line.
